# Social-Media-App
Social media app made with react

This full-stack web application is built using a modern tech stack, combining React for the dynamic and interactive front end.

Node.js with Express.js handles the server-side logic, while MongoDB serves as the database for efficient data storage.

Tailwind CSS is employed to streamline and enhance the styling process, facilitating a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

The application includes features commonly found in social media platforms.

Security is a priority, with the implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) ensuring a secure connection between the client and server.

This setup prevents unauthorized client-side modifications, providing a robust and reliable user experience.

Additionally, the inclusion of dark mode enhances user customization and accessibility.

The project showcases the seamless integration of these technologies to deliver a well-rounded web application.
